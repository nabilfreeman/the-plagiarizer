Please use The Plagiarizer responsibly.

# current situation

- The front end looks cool
- All attempts at plagiarising have resulted in gibberish
- I've learnt that it is soooo difficult to preserve context in English language. Respect to Google Translate and the other players.
- It would be cool to have some sort of indicator of changed words, and when you hover over them it shows the original. Or something.

# attempts

- Using a giant (16mb) front-loaded JSON thesaurus, and running a simple replace on every word in the input text
- Writing a small list of words to replace (and, also, that, etc) to try and preserve context

# future experiments
- Very carefully adding more words to the non-contextual list
- Using the Words API or Spinbot API (easy but not open source)
- Finding an open source library that does the above
