var one = "In the cold, dark dawn of October 8, 1916, the 56th Division renewed its push from Lesboeufs towards Le Transloy on the Somme. As the British soldiers climbed out of their front line, the German machine guns opened up and stopped the attack dead. Among the wounded of the 1/3rd Battalion, London Regiment was L/Cpl John Shaw. He later wrote to his mother in what he felt might be his last ever letter. \"I have been shot through the hips and cannot use my right leg, properly knocked up. Pity, when one gets a Blighty one too, after so long. Well darling, I am still cheerful of getting home. If not you will receive this letter which they surely will send to know I died for my country and home like a man. I am laying writing this on the Somme Battle. It is some battle too, I can tell you. The noise of the shells and guns worry the life out of anyone. Remember me to all the girls. Dear Alice, Ada and Tina. Also Alf. Tell them I died the death of a soldier and man. Whatever you do, dear, don’t worry yourself. Promise me that. All for a good cause.\" John Shaw was sent to hospital in Rouen, but died of his wounds on October 18. Yet as his letter shows, he did not regard his death as a waste. He believed the war to be just and he remained philosophical about the consequences for him. To most people today, the 1916 Battle of the Somme appears unremittingly futile. Even more than Passchendaele and Gallipoli, in Britain it seems to represent the nadir of the First World War. No other moment comes so close to defining the popular understanding of 1914-18. Britain has no clear foundation myth linked to the war. There is no Gallipoli as for Australia and New Zealand, or Vimy Ridge for Canada; just the Somme, throbbing in the side of the nation like an unhealed wound. Britain’s unbroken connection to the chalk uplands of Picardy dates back to 1914 when a powerful upsurge of enthusiasm drove a million men to enlist well before Christmas. Men started to join up together in battalions of \"pals\" in affirmation of their collective way of life. They shared common values and wanted to defend these against the growing threat that appeared to be coming out of Germany. In Yorkshire, the men of Leeds, Bradford, Barnsley, Sheffield and Hull coalesced into the 31st Division of Kitchener’s New Army. They trained hard and, with some interlopers accepted from outside the county – from Accrington in Lancashire and as far away as Durham – they began the long march that by summer 1916 led them to the Somme. On July 1, the opening of the \"great push\", the 31st Division was on the northern edge of the battle facing strong German positions at Serre. At 7.30am, the British rose up, with the men from Leeds, Accrington and Sheffield in the lead. None made it across no-man’s-land. Despite a week-long bombardment, the German defenders scythed them down. In less than an hour, the pals suffered around 1,500 casualties. As news filtered home, families, factories and sports clubs felt bereft. This remains the received vision of July 1, 1916: slaughter and loss, futility and sacrifice; the bloodiest day in the British Army’s history, with almost 20,000 men killed and 40,000 more wounded. The scale of the disaster overshadows and obscures any deeper understanding of the day. Yet it was not all like this. On the southern end of the British line, the 30th Division also went over the top. It too was populated by northern pals, from Manchester and Liverpool. Supported by stronger and more effective artillery, including the better-supplied French guns to their right, and propelled by more imaginative tactics, the Lancastrians surged steadily forward from Maricourt and successfully took their objective of Montauban. They showed that, given a fair chance, Kitchener’s men could fight and overcome the German defences. Although achieved at considerable cost, the capture of the positions along this southern edge of the battle was the first time in the war that planned objectives had been taken and held in a major offensive. Nothing provides a greater contrast in the history of the war than the abject failure in the north at Serre and the stirring achievements in the south at Montauban. Few know about the successes there. July 1 is remembered solely as an unmitigated disaster. Yet for historians it represents the beginning of a process of growth and development that reaches through to the end of the war and German defeat. In the weeks of hard, bloody fighting that followed, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Somme was joined by men from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Key lessons were learnt by front-line soldiers and their generals in how to use new weapons such as the Lewis gun, trench mortar, grenade and even the impressive but still limited tank. Artillery was employed to ever greater effect with new fuses on the shells and as a creeping barrage to offer closer support to advancing infantry. Soldiers began to fight in smaller units, with riflemen working closely with men using the new weapons. By November, when the worsening weather forced the suspension of immediate operations, it was a very different war from the one encountered on the first day. The men of the BEF had come of age. Since the 50th anniversary of the Somme in 1966, historians have struggled to draw out and explain these lessons. Despite decades of research and writing, people find it hard to get past the bleak balance sheet of the fighting: 141 days leading to a maximum advance of seven miles. For Britain and its Empire this came at the cost of almost 420,000 casualties including 125,000 dead. German casualties were higher, between 437,000 and 680,000. What positive outcome could be found in that? Combined with their heavy losses against the French at Verdun, the Germans realised they could not repeat their experience on the Somme. The price had been too high. A change in German military leadership led to a new policy. A new defensive line was built some way to the rear that could be held with fewer men. Known as the Hindenburg Line, the Germans believed it to be impregnable. In mid- February, 1917, German front-line troops began to fall towards their new positions. The ground taken from them as they withdrew was as direct a result of the Somme as the hard-won gains taken in the battle itself and only with the capture of these positions did the fighting really end. At the same time, recognising that they would be unable to win the war that year in the west, the Germans decided to suspend their attacks there. Instead, in a clear new strategic policy, they chose to use the submarine to strike hard against Britain in an attempt to force it out of the war. Only a few weeks later, when the BEF returned to the offensive, it showed how much it had learnt on the Somme. On April 9, the opening day of the Battle of Arras, significant gains were made. Vimy Ridge was captured by the Canadians and in places the British advanced up to three and a half miles. It demonstrated the BEF’s growing proficiency as a fighting force. The pace of this development rolled on throughout 1917. At Ypres along the Menin Road and at Broodseinde and Cambrai in the initial strike, British and Imperial forces operated with a stronger, more professional edge. At each stage the Germans showed how much they, too, were learning in parallel with the British, with the result that losses on both sides remained uncomfortably high and the ambitions of British attacks were often thwarted. Yet, bolstered by growing numbers of newly arrived American troops, in the spring of 1918 when the Germans turned the tables with a series of massive attacks up and down the front, the BEF defended with great determination. By the time they launched their own counteroffensive on the Somme on August 8, 1918, the British and Imperial soldiers had become ruthlessly efficient, honed by repeated battles and the careful study of their mistakes and successes. Weapons and tactics developed over months of experience were all incorporated into a new \"all-arms\" battle that began to wear down the increasingly exhausted Germans. The Australian commander, Lt Gen Sir John Monash, observed that \"a perfected modern battle plan is like nothing so much as a score for an orchestral composition, where the various arms and units are the instruments, and the tasks they perform are their respective musical phrases\". The generals began to conduct their orchestras with considerable skill, bringing in tanks, aircraft, machine guns, artillery and infantry at the place and moment where they could have maximum effect. The 38th Welsh Division had struggled to capture Mametz Wood in July, 1916. Now they swept over the whole of the old battleground in a matter of days. The British advance pushed on towards the Hindenburg Line. But this time the ground was not given up by the Germans. It was taken from them by force of arms, trench by trench, machine gun by machine gun. When, on September 29, the Hindenburg Line was broken open, it was ordinary soldiers from the heartland of Britaina who led the way using skills they had picked up on the Somme. For historians, this shows the steady progress and gradual improvement that sees the BEF climb a steep but rewarding learning curve. From the inexperienced, naive force of 1914 it becomes a hardnosed professional army in 1918 that carries the Allies inexorably to the November 11 Armistice. Yet despite all this, for ordinary people the argument fails to convince. In Accrington, Sheffield, Liverpool and Manchester, they still feel the loss of their men. Along with thousands of lives, hope and innocence also seemed to die on the Somme in 1916. The battle dealt a fatal blow to the optimism and pride of the nation, as Philip Larkin articulated 50 years later in his poem MCMXIV.";

var two = "Exposed, dim sunrise of October 8, 1916, the 56th Division restored its push from Lesboeufs towards Le Transloy on the Somme. As the British officers moved out of their cutting edge, the German automatic rifles opened up and halted the assault dead. Among the injured of the 1/3rd Battalion, London Regiment was L/Cpl John Shaw. He later kept in touch with his mom in what he felt may be his last ever letter. \"I have been shot through the hips and can't utilize my right leg, appropriately pregnant. Pity, when one gets a Blighty one as well, after so long. Well sweetheart, I am still merry of returning home. If not you will get this letter which they most likely will send to know I kicked the bucket for my nation and home like a man. I am laying written work this on the Somme Battle. It is some fight as well, I can let you know. The clamor of the shells and firearms stress the life out of anybody. Recollect that me to all the young ladies. Dear Alice, Ada and Tina. Additionally Alf. Let them know I passed on the passing of a trooper and man. Whatever you do, dear, don't stress yourself. Guarantee me that. Just for a decent cause.\" John Shaw was sent to healing facility in Rouen, however kicked the bucket of his injuries on October 18. Yet as his letter shows, he didn't see his demise as a waste. He accepted the war to be just and he stayed philosophical about the results for him. To a great many people today, the 1916 Battle of the Somme shows up unremittingly pointless. Significantly more than Passchendaele and Gallipoli, in Britain it appears to speak to the nadir of the First World War. No other minute verges on characterizing the famous comprehension of 1914-18. England has no reasonable establishment myth connected to the war. There is no Gallipoli with respect to Australia and New Zealand, or Vimy Ridge for Canada; simply the Somme, throbbing in the side of the country like an unhealed injury. England's unbroken association with the chalk uplands of Picardy goes back to 1914 when an intense upsurge of eagerness drove a million men to enroll well before Christmas. Men began to sign up together in forces of \"buddies\" in assertion of their aggregate lifestyle. They shared normal values and needed to shield these against the developing danger that had all the earmarks of being leaving Germany. In Yorkshire, the men of Leeds, Bradford, Barnsley, Sheffield and Hull combine into the 31st Division of Kitchener's New Army. They prepared hard and, with a few gatecrashers acknowledged from outside the district – from Accrington in Lancashire and as far away as Durham – they started the long walk that by summer 1916 drove them to the Somme. On July 1, the opening of the \"colossal push\", the 31st Division was on the northern edge of the fight confronting solid German positions at Serre. At 7.30am, the British rose up, with the men from Leeds, Accrington and Sheffield leading the pack. None made it over no-man's-land. In spite of a week-long assault, the German shields scythed them down. In under 60 minutes, the buddies endured around 1,500 setbacks. As news sifted home, families, processing plants and games clubs felt deprived. This remaining parts the got vision of July 1, 1916: butcher and misfortune, worthlessness and penance; the bloodiest day in the British Army's history, with right around 20,000 men killed and 40,000 more injured. The size of the debacle eclipses and darkens any more profound comprehension of the day. Yet it was not every single like thi. On the southern end of the British line, the 30th Division likewise went ludicrous. It too was populated by northern buddies, from Manchester and Liverpool. Bolstered by more grounded and more compelling cannons, including the better-supplied French firearms on their right side, and impelled by more creative strategies, the Lancastrians surged consistently forward from Maricourt and effectively took their target of Montauban. They demonstrated that, given a reasonable chance, Kitchener's men could battle and defeat the German guards. Albeit accomplished at significant expense, the catch of the positions along this southern edge of the fight was the first run through in the war that arranged targets had been taken and held in a noteworthy hostile. Nothing gives a more prominent complexity in the historical backdrop of the war than the miserable disappointment in the north at Serre and the mixing accomplishments in the south at Montauban. Few think about the victories there. July 1 is recollected singularly as an unmitigated debacle. Yet for students of history it speaks to the start of a procedure of development and advancement that spans through to the end of the war and German rout. In the weeks of hard, ridiculous battling that took after, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Somme was joined by men from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Key lessons were learnt by cutting edge troopers and their officers in how to utilize new weapons, for example, the Lewis firearm, trench mortar, explosive and even the great yet at the same time restricted tank. Big guns was utilized to ever more prominent impact with new wires on the shells and as an inching torrent to offer closer backing to propelling infantry. Troopers started to battle in littler units, with marksmen working intently with men utilizing the new weapons. By November, when the declining climate constrained the suspension of quick operations, it was an altogether different war from the one experienced on the first day. The men of the BEF had grow up. Since the 50th commemoration of the Somme in 1966, students of history have attempted to draw out and clarify these lessons. Regardless of many years of examination and composing, individuals think that it difficult to move beyond the depressing accounting report of the battling: 141 days prompting a greatest development of seven miles. For Britain and its Empire this took a swing at the expense of just about 420,000 losses including 125,000 dead. German losses were higher, somewhere around 437,000 and 680,000. What positive result could be found in that? Joined with their overwhelming misfortunes against the French at Verdun, the Germans acknowledged they couldn't rehash their experience on the Somme. The cost had been too high. A change in German military initiative prompted another strategy. Another cautious line was constructed somehow to the back that could be held with less men. Known as the Hindenburg Line, the Germans trusted it to be secure. In mid- February, 1917, German cutting edge troops started to fall towards their new positions. The ground taken from them as they withdrew was as immediate a consequence of the Somme as the hard-won additions taken in the fight itself and just with the catch of these positions did the battling truly end. In the meantime, perceiving that they would be not able to win the war that year in the west, the Germans chose to suspend their assaults there. Rather, in a reasonable new key strategy, they decided to utilize the submarine to strike hard against Britain trying to constrain it out of the war. Just a couple of weeks after the fact, when the BEF came back to the hostile, it demonstrated the amount it had learnt on the Somme. On April 9, the opening day of the Battle of Arras, huge additions were made. Vimy Ridge was caught by the Canadians and in places the British progressed up to three and a half miles. It showed the BEF's developing capability as a battling power. The pace of this advancement moved on all through 1917. At Ypres along the Menin Road and at Broodseinde and Cambrai in the starting strike, British and Imperial powers worked with a more grounded, more expert edge. At every stage the Germans demonstrated the amount they, as well, were adapting in parallel with the British, with the outcome that misfortunes on both sides remained uncomfortably high and the desire of British assaults were regularly frustrated. Yet, reinforced by developing quantities of recently arrived American troops, in the spring of 1918 when the Germans turned the tables with a progression of gigantic assaults all over the front, the BEF guarded with extraordinary determination. When they dispatched their own particular counteroffensive on the Somme on August 8, 1918, the British and Imperial warriors had turn out to be mercilessly productive, sharpened by rehashed fights and the cautious investigation of their slip-ups and triumphs. Weapons and strategies grew over months of experience were all consolidated into another \"all-arms\" fight that started to wear out the undeniably depleted Germans. The Australian leader, Lt Gen Sir John Monash, watched that \"an idealized advanced fight arrangement is similar to nothing such a great amount as a score for a symphonic sythesis, where the different arms and units are the instruments, and the assignments they perform are their individual musical expressions\". The commanders started to lead their ensembles with extensive ability, acquiring tanks, airplane, automatic weapons, mounted guns and infantry at the spot and minute where they could have most extreme impact. The 38th Welsh Division had attempted to catch Mametz Wood in July, 1916. Presently they cleared over the entire of the old battleground in a matter of days. The British development pushed on towards the Hindenburg Line. Yet, this time the ground was not surrendered by the Germans. It was taken from them by power of arms, trench by trench, automatic rifle by assault rifle. At the point when, on September 29, the Hindenburg Line was torn open, it was conventional warriors from the heartland of Britaina who drove the way utilizing abilities they had gotten on the Somme. For history specialists, this demonstrates the relentless advancement and slow change that sees the BEF climb a precarious yet remunerating expectation to absorb information. From the unpracticed, innocent power of 1914 it turns into an obstinate proficient armed force in 1918 that conveys the Allies relentlessly to the November 11 Armistice. Yet regardless of this, for standard individuals the contention neglects to persuade. In Accrington, Sheffield, Liverpool and Manchester, despite everything they feel the loss of their men. Alongside a large number of lives, trust and blamelessness likewise appeared to kick the bucket on the Somme in 1916. The fight managed a deadly hit to the good faith and pride of the country, as Philip Larkin explained after 50 years in his sonnet MCM";
